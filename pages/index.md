# Lucia

Lucia is an open source project to provide resources on implementing authentication with JavaScript and TypeScript.

The main section is on implementing sessions with your database, library, and framework of choice. Using the API you just created, you can continue learning by going through the tutorials or by referencing the many fully-fledged examples.

If you have any questions on anything related to auth, feel free to ask them in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/PwrK3kpVR3) or on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/lucia-auth/lucia/discussions)!

## Why not a library?

We've found it extremely hard to develop a library that:

1. Supports the many database libraries, ORMs, frameworks, runtimes, and deployment options available in the ecosystem.
2. Provides enough flexibility for the majority of use cases.
3. Does not add significant complexity to projects.

We came to the conclusion that at least for the core of auth - sessions - it's better to teach the code and concepts rather than to try cramming it into a library. The code is very straightforward and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to write it once you understand it. As an added bonus, it's fully customizable.
