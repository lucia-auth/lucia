# Email and password

Email-based auth requires a lot of components so be prepared to do some work! For a step-by-step, framework-specific tutorial to learn the basics of password-based auth and Lucia, see the [Username and password](/tutorials/username-and-password) tutorial.

This guide uses [Oslo](https://oslo.js.org), a library that provides various auth-related utilities. This is also used by Lucia internally.

```
npm i oslo
```
