# Tutorial: Username and password auth

The tutorials go over how to implement a basic username and password auth and cover the basics of Lucia along the way. As a prerequisite, you should be fairly comfortable with your framework and its APIs. For a more in-depth guide, see the [Email and password](/guides/email-and-password/) guides. Basic example projects are available in the [examples repository](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples).
