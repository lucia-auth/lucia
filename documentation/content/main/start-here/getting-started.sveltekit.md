Install Lucia using your package manager of your choice.

```
npm i lucia-auth
pnpm add lucia-auth
yarn add lucia-auth
```

## Set up the database

To support multiple databases, Lucia uses database adapters. These adapters provide a set of standardized methods to read from and update the database. Custom adapters can be created as well if Lucia does not provide one.

We currently support the following database/ORM options:

- [Drizzle ORM](/adapters/drizzle)
- [Kysely](/adapters/kysely)
- [Mongoose](/adapters/mongoose)
- [MySQL](/adapters/mysql)
- [PlanetScale serverless](/adapters/planetscale)
- [PostgreSQL](/adapters/postgresql)
- [Prisma](/adapters/prisma)
- [Redis](/adapters/redis)
- [SQLite](/adapters/sqlite)

## Initialize Lucia

In `$lib/server/lucia.ts`, import [`lucia`](/reference/lucia-auth/auth) from `lucia-auth`. Initialize it by defining `adapter` and `env` and export it. Additionally, we will import the SvelteKit middleware and pass it on to `middleware`. Make sure to export `typeof auth` as well.

```ts
// lib/server/lucia.ts
import lucia from "lucia-auth";
import { sveltekit } from "lucia-auth/middleware";
import prisma from "@lucia-auth/adapter-prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { dev } from "$app/environment";

export const auth = lucia({
	adapter: prisma(new PrismaClient()),
	env: dev ? "DEV" : "PROD",
	middleware: sveltekit()
});

export type Auth = typeof auth;
```

This module and the file that holds it **should NOT be imported from the client**.

## Configure your SvelteKit project

### Hooks

Create a server hooks file (`src/hooks.server.ts`) and import the `auth` module. Since we used the SvelteKit middleware, `handleRequest()` is compatible with SvelteKit's APIs.

```ts
// hooks.server.ts
import { auth } from "$lib/server/lucia";
import type { Handle } from "@sveltejs/kit";

export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
	event.locals.auth = auth.handleRequest(event);
	return await resolve(event);
};
```

You can now get the current session and user using the methods within `event.locals.auth`, which is available in every server context.

```ts
const session = await event.locals.auth.validate();
const { session, user } = await event.locals.auth.validateUser();
```

### Defining types

In `src/app.d.ts`, configure your types. The path in `import('$lib/server/lucia.js').Auth;` is where you exported `auth` (`lucia()`).

```ts
// src/app.d.ts
declare global {
	namespace App {
		interface Locals {
			auth: import("lucia-auth").AuthRequest;
		}
	}
}

/// <reference types="lucia-auth" />
declare global {
	namespace Lucia {
		type Auth = import("$lib/lucia").Auth;
		type UserAttributes = {};
	}
}

// THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!
export {};
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get the following error or something similar:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'validate')
```

Make sure your `handle` hook is running. Common mistakes include:

1. `hook.sever.ts` (singular) instead of `hooks.server.ts` (plural)
2. `hooks.server.ts` inside `routes` directory instead of `src` directory
3. `+hooks.server.ts` (`+`) instead of `hooks.server.ts`
