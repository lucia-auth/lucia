# Lucia

**This library is still in beta! While APIs have been relatively stable recently in preparation for v1.0, expect breaking changes.**

Lucia is a simple yet flexible user and session management library that provides an
abstraction layer between your app and your database. It's bare-bones by design, keeping
everything easy to use and understand. Get started by reading the [introduction page](https://lucia-auth.vercel.app/learn/start-here/introduction).

### Code sample

Working with Lucia looks something like this. In the code below, you're creating a new user with a email/password method, creating a new session, and creating a cookie that you can set it to the user.

```ts
const user = await auth.createUser("email", email, {
	password
});
const session = await auth.createSession(user.userId);
const sessionCookie = auth.createSessionCookie(session);
```
